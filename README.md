# Homework-13

##Doggy Friend Finder

####Notes

1. Generated 6 'profiles' for testing purposes, pictures are google images of dogs
2. I got the front-end from the demo site just to make everything faster - played around with glyphicons etc on the Home page
3. Survey page - Selects made using chosen. I also did front end validation through JQuery Validator - 2/3rd of my time on this assignment was spend figuring out how to make the validator work with bootstrap
*All for 1 2-year old meme on the last question, try entering any value less than 4 for the last question, 4-5 hours spent making a bad joke*
4. Have some ongoing issues with front end validation but for the most part, everything seems to work as expected.
